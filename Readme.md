**Data.world Product Hunt dataset analysis**

The datasets I used are too big to store on github. Please download from https://data.world/exercises/producthunt-exercise.

I am using python to conduct a basic analysis of product hunt products. The goal is to find if there is a subset of users that accurately predict the success of early stage ideas. 

To do this, I am using pandas, numpy, seaborn, and cufflinks to analyze, visualize, and discover paterns in the data
