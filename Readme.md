**Data.world Product Hunt dataset analysis**

The datasets I used are too big to store on github. Please download from https://data.world/exercises/producthunt-exercise.

I am using python to conduct a basic analysis of product hunt products. The goal is to find if there is a subset of users that accurately predict the success of early stage ideas. 

To do this, I am using pandas, numpy, seaborn, and cufflinks to analyze, visualize, and discover paterns in the data.

I started by looking for user interaction patterns by times and days of the week. This will allow me to consider how visible the products are if posted on a day of the week. Hopefully, I can use this information to find the best time to post on Product Hunt. This will give each product the best chance of success after considering the patterns of users.
